# tictactoe-using-reinforment-learning
This project implements and evaluates two reinforcement learning algorithms, TD-Q Learning and SARSA, using the SimpleAI library, which provides an RL. Both agents learn Tic-Tac-Toe by storing rewards in a Q-table representing state-action pairs. The TD-Q Learning agent outperformed the SARSA agent in both game success and learning efficiency.
